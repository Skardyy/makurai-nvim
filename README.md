just another vim theme ~ a minimal theme done right

1. doesn't use italic or bold fonts
2. highlights only
   - keywords (not operators)
   - functions
   - strings
   - constants
   - types (not namespaces or modules)
3. for some highlights uses colors that are weak and barely noticable, yet distinct enough to not blend in
