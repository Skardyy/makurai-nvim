just another vim theme ~ a minimal theme done right

1. doesn't use italic or bold fonts
2. highlights only
   - keywords (not operators)
   - functions
   - strings
   - constants
   - types (not namespaces or modules)
3. for some highlights uses colors that are weak and barely noticable, yet distinct enough to not blend in
4. sets most of the ui colors to be NONE, so the terminal will be responsible for the colors
